==========

Project: Create a clock which converts time into RGB data, and displays the corresponding color on the page.

Description: On hearing the nature of the assignment, my mind was immediately drawn to the idea of colors shifting as being something inherently 'trippy', and decided to push things tremendously in that direction. I used animated GIFs to accentuate the hallucinatory affect of the color-changes.

Why?: While the initial assignment provided challenges for my emerging abilities, it was just fun to push things in the design direction I pushed the project towards.

Tech used: Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS.

Future Updates: I will continue to hone the color changes to make them somewhat more noticeable, work with the css arrangement of things, and see if I can get the clock itself to animate in a warped fashion.
